      Hello, my name is Calvin. I was born and raised in Brooklyn, New York
      in a neighborhood called Bensonhurst. I enjoy listening to
      <a href="https://soundcloud.com/icalving"> music</a>, watching tv
      shows/movies, reading manga/watching anime, playing video games, and
      writing <a href="https://github.com/ICalvinG"> code</a>.
    </p>

      One odd fact about me is that I tend to have a endless void of trivial
      knowledge as I happen to fall into the wikipedia rabbit hole easily
      losing hours of my time. This does work in my favor because it means I
      can be conversational about almost anything and very good to have on
      your trivia night team.
    </p>

      One of my favorite things to do is to travel because I embrace the feeling
      of not knowing and there is just so much in this world to discover. My
      stomach and taste buds also thank me because I believe one of the quickest
      ways to learn another culture is through food.
